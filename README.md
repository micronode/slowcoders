# Introduction

The software industry has been the source of much cultural and societal change. With the increasing integration of technology globally this will continue to be the case.

## Language and communication

With new communications technologies comes new forms of expression. Emoticons, abbreviations and acronyms have all flourished in online communities, and will ultimately become part of native languages.

## Ethical and moral choices

The Internet has exposed (and facilitated) many cultural and lifestyle practices that are widely recognised as immoral and/or unethical. Just as technology can facilate such practices it also has the power to eradicate.

## Political movements and vox pop

Technology should be seen as an opportunity to level the playing field. To disrupt established power centres and empower communities that have long been ignored. Lobby groups should be exposed with full disclosure of motives to allow real choices to be made with all the available information.

## Altruism and perfectability

The constant test/refine cycle of software is bound up in a desire for portability and singular purpose. We should not be distracted by advertising placement or profits for shareholders. Transparency and altruism should be the driving force behind everything, and success/rewards will follow.
